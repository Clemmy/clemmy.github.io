          I am a software engineer that has worked in a variety of roles ranging
          from early-stage startups to bigger organizations. My strength lies in
          dealing with ambiguity, breaking down complex pieces of product
          requirements into MVPs that maximize user impact.

          <br />I find immense value in learning from others, whether it be
          through reading books, watching videos, or more dedicated mentorship.
          I have learned a great deal this way and would love to give back to
          the community.
